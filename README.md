This is my btech Thesis project which I did under Sayak Bhattacharya.
I have started this project on Aug 2023, in which in starting we have to read a book named" ADAPTIVE MESH REFINEMENT FOR A FINITE DIFFERENCE SCHEME".
In which i have to read about the different type of meshing technique.
And try to apply that on the 2D and 3D shape of figure to see the small changes and with that different method of refinement we have to make an small grids.
And analyse the change of any quantity like in semiconductor we have resistance and voltage.
We can see the change in these quantity by grids.
